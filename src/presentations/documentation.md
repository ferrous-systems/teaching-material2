`rustdoc`
=========

Rust provides a standard documentation tool called `rustdoc`. It is
commonly used through `cargo doc`.

Because of this Rust code is almost always documented in a common
format.

`std` Documentation
===================

The standard library documentation is hosted at
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/>.

A local, offline version can be opened with:

```console
    rustup doc --std
```
Crate Documentation
===================

Documentation for crates hosted on <http://crates.io/> can be found at
<https://docs.rs/>.

Some crates may also have other documentation found via the
"Documentation" link on their listing in <http://crates.io/>.

Example: A Module
=================

This page documents the `vec` module.

It starts with some examples, then lists any \`struct\`s, traits, or
functions the module exports.

How is it Generated?
====================

`rustdoc` can read Rust code and Markdown documents.

`//!` and `///` comments are read as Markdown.
```rust
    //! Module documentation. (e.g. the 'Examples' part of `std::vec`).

    /// Document functions, structs, traits and values.
    /// This documents a function.
    fn function_with_documentation() {}

    // This comment will not be shown as documentation.
    // The function itself will be.
    fn function_without_documentation() {}
```
Example: Components
===================

Example: Functions
==================

Code Examples
=============

By default code blocks in documentation are tested.
```rust,ignore
/// ```rust 
/// assert_eq!(always_true(), true)
/// ```
fn always_true() -> bool { true }
```

No-Run Examples
===============

This code will not be run, as it doesnâ€™t terminate.

```rust,ignore
/// ```rust,no_run
/// serve(); 
/// ```
fn serve() -> ! {
    loop
    {} 
}
```

Navigation
==========

The arguments and return types of functions are links to their
respective types.

The sidebar on the left offers quick navigate to other parts of the
module.

Cargo integration
=================

This command builds and opens the docs to your current project:

```console,ignore
$ cargo doc --open 
```

!
=

```console,ignore
$ cargo doc --document-private-items --open 
```

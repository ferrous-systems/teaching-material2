# libcore and libstd

!
=

Rust ships with two base libraries, libcore and libstd.

!
=

libcore contains all types necessary to make the language work.

libcore is allocation free.

!
=

libcore is usually not used directly, as its public interface is
reexported by libstd.

!
=

libstd contains standard functions, for example to interact with the
file system. It has a dependency to the platform libc.

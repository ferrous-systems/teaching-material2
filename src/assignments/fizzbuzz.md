In this exercise, we will implement our first tiny program: FizzBuzz.
FizzBuzz is easy to implement, but allows for application of Rust
patterns in a very clean fasion.

You will learn:

-   How to write a simple Rust program

-   How to create and return owned `String` s

-   How to use conditionals

-   How to format strings with and without printing them to the system
    console

Task
----

1.  Use Cargo to create a new project called `fizzbuzz`

2.  Implement the following function:

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
    fn fizzbuzz(i: u32) -> String {
        //...
    }

```
    
Implementing the following rules:

-   If `i` is divisible by `3`, return `String::from("Fizz")`

-   If `i` is divisible by `5`, return `String::from("Buzz")`

-   If `i` is divisible by both `3` and `5`, return `String::from("FizzBuzz")`

-   Return the number as a String, otherwise, using `i.to_string()`

-   Test the function

3.  Write a main function that loops from `1` to `100` using `for`

-   Call the `fizzbuzz` function inside the loop and store the result in the variable `fizz`.

-   Print the returned value using `println!("{}", fizz)`

Help
----

This section gives partial solutions to look at or refer to.

In general, we also recommend to use the Rust documentation to figure
out things you are missing to familiarise yourself with it. If you ever
feel completely stuck or that you havenâ€™t understood something, please
hail the trainers quickly.

Getting Started
---------------

Create a new binary Cargo project, check the build and see if it runs:

```console
cargo new fizzbuzz 
cd fizzbuzz 
cargo run
```

Creating Strings
----------------

The recommended ways to get a `String` type for this exercise are:

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
    let string = String::from("Fizz");
    let i = 4;
    let string = i.to_string();
```

Counting from 1 to 100
----------------------

If you have issues that your program only counts to 99, be aware that
the `..`-range syntax in Rust is *end-exclusive*. Either move the bound
or use the inclusive range syntax.

```rust,does_not_compile,ignore
    for i in 1..5 {
        // Only gives you 1, 2, 3, 4
    }

    for i in 1..=5 {
        // Gives you 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
    }
```

Returning data
--------------

If you have issues returning data from multiple branches of your
solution, liberally use `return`.

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
    if x % 5 == 0 {
        return String::from("Buzz");
    }
```
Printing to console
-------------------

The recommended way to print to the console in this exercise is
`println!`. `println!` *always* needs a format string - it uses `{}` as
a placeholder to mean **print the next argument**, like Python 3 or C\#.

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
    let s = String::from("Fizz");
    println!("The value is s is {}. That's nice.", s);
```

Testing
-------

Testing functions are annotated using the `#[test]` attribute,
assertions use `assert!(expr == expr)` or `assert_eq!(expr, expr)`.
```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
    #[test]
    fn my_test() {
        assert_eq!(1, 1);
    }
```

In this exercise, you will learn

-   how to implement `Drop` and `Write` traits.

-   the "`Drop guard`" pattern.

-   how to test panicking APIs.

`std::fs::File` type has a
[`sync_all`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fs/struct.File.html#method.sync_all)
method which ensures that all data is written to disk. This method is
not called by default: syncing is slow and OS has good heuristics for
optimistically delaying syncing.

In this assignment, weâ€™ll implement a `DurableFile` wrapper for `File`,
which helps to ensure that applications calls `sync_all`. Specifically,
`DurableFile` tracks syncs and writes. If a `DurableFile` is dropped
with an outstanding write, its `Drop` panics. Not calling `sync_all`
before disposing the file is considered a bug in this case. Panic helps
to elevate silent potential data loss into a loud failure.

Step 1  
Implement `DurableFile` data structure:

    struct DurableFile {
        file: std::fs::File,
        needs_sync: bool,
    }

Step 2  
Implement a constructor:

    impl DurableFile {
        pub fn new(file: std::fs::File) -> DurableFile {
            ...
        }
    }

Optional: implement
[`From<std::fs::File>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/conversion/from_into.html)
for DurableFile

Step 3  
Implement the
[`std::io::Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Write.html)
trait for `DurableFile`. Use `sync_all` in the implementation of the
`flush` method. All write operations should set the `needs_sync` flag,
the `flush` method should clear it.

Step 4  
Implement the
[`std::ops::Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html)
trait for `DurableFile` so that it panics if the file is not flushed.
What is the right behavior for `Drop`? Are there any edge cases to worry
about?

Step 5  
Add an inherent `close` method for for `DurableFile`, to explicitly
sync&dispose the file and handle potential errors. What is the
appropriate signature (type of `self` and the return type) for `close`?

Step 6  
Write a couple of simple smoke tests. You might find the
[`tempdir`](https://docs.rs/tempdir/0.3.7/tempdir/) crate and
[`#[should_panic]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/testing.html#the-should_panic-attribute)
attribute useful!

    #[test]
    #[should_panic(expected = "not yet implemented")]
    fn smoke_test() {
        let dir = tempdir::TempDir::new("tests").unwrap();
        let file = std::fs::File::create(dir.path().join("foo.txt")).unwrap();
        todo!()
    }
